1638. Count Substrings That Differ by One Character
Medium


Given two strings s and t, find the number of ways you can choose a non-empty substring of s and replace a single character by a different character such that
the resulting substring is a substring of t. In other words, find the number of substrings in s that differ from some substring in t by exactly one character.
For example, the underlined substrings in "computer" and "computation" only differ by the 'e'/'a', so this is a valid way.
Return the number of substrings that satisfy the condition above.
A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.

Example 1:
Input: s = "aba", t = "baba"
Output: 6
Explanation: The following are the pairs of substrings from s and t that differ by exactly 1 character:
("aba", "baba")
("aba", "baba")
("aba", "baba")
("aba", "baba")
("aba", "baba")
("aba", "baba")
The underlined portions are the substrings that are chosen from s and t.

Example 2:
Input: s = "ab", t = "bb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The following are the pairs of substrings from s and t that differ by 1 character:
("ab", "bb")
("ab", "bb")
("ab", "bb")
The underlined portions are the substrings that are chosen from s and t.
 
Constraints:
1 <= s.length, t.length <= 100
s and t consist of lowercase English letters only.
