1716. Calculate Money in Leetcode Bank
Easy


Hercy wants to save money for his first car. He puts money in the Leetcode bank every day.
He starts by putting in $1 on Monday, the first day. Every day from Tuesday to Sunday, he will put in $1 more than the day before. 
On every subsequent Monday, he will put in $1 more than the previous Monday.
Given n, return the total amount of money he will have in the Leetcode bank at the end of the nth day.

Example 1:
Input: n = 4
Output: 10
Explanation: After the 4th day, the total is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10.

Example 2:
Input: n = 10
Output: 37
Explanation: After the 10th day, the total is (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7) + (2 + 3 + 4) = 37. Notice that on the 2nd Monday, Hercy only puts in $2.

Example 3: 
Input: n = 20
Output: 96
Explanation: After the 20th day, the total is (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7) + (2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8) + (3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8) = 96.
 

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 1000

///Logic:Here first initialize sum with 0 and 2 temp variables with 1,now run from 1 till n and first add j to sum and increment j each time,here j will be 1,2,3,4....
///now if i%7==0 ie it will be multiple of 7 then first increment temp like for first monday temp was 1 then for next monday temp=2 then for next temp=3  and at last return sum.
